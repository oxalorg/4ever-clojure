@borkdude suggested this in his tweet:

And so I made it, using the awesome [sci](https://github.com/borkdude/sci) and
special thanks to [4bb](https://github.com/porkostomus/4bb) from where I copied
the problems edn.

## Live

Deployed at [https://4clojure.oxal.org/](https://4clojure.oxal.org/)

## Solutions archive

You can view the solutions from each individual page eg: https://4clojure.oxal.org/#/problem/102/solutions

The archive repo is available at: https://github.com/oxalorg/4clojure-solutions-archive/

## Develop

This project uses shadow-cljs, so the easiest way to use this would be:

```
npm install # only needed once
npx shadow-cljs watch :my-build
```

If you are a fan of emacs and cider, then you can open up emacs and run
`cider-jack-in-cljs`. It will automatically start shadow-cljs in watch
mode.

shadow hosts the dev server at http://localhost:8000

## Test your own version live

You can deploy your own instance via GitHub Actions:

1. Go to Settings -> Pages
1. Choose Build and deployment -> Github Actions
1. Upload your repository or trigger the build

## Todos

- [x] Ship a crude version
- [x] Make it noice!
- [x] use localstorage to store solutions
- [x] easy navigation
- [x] scrape problem difficulty (can perhaps also get ranks data?)
- [ ] better alerts (modals?)
- [x] show user which problems they have solved
- [ ] import /export data of the user in a .edn file
- [ ] github actions auto deployment
- [ ] create a new section of problems "community powered questions"
- [ ] add new community problems directly via github
