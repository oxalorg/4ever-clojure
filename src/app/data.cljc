When you combine the two together,
you get something very powerful called lexical closures.
With these, you can exercise a great deal
of control over the lifetime of your local bindings,
saving their values for use later,
long after the code you're running now has finished.

It can be hard to follow in the abstract,
so let's build a simple closure.
Given a positive integer n,
return a function (f x) which computes xn.
Observe that the effect of this is to preserve the value of n
for use outside the scope in which it is defined.

    :description "Everyone loves triangles,
and it’s easy to understand why —
they’re so wonderfully symmetric
(except scalenes, they suck).

Your passion for triangles has led you to become a miner
(and part-time Clojure programmer) where you work all day
to chip out isosceles-shaped minerals from rocks
gathered in a nearby open-pit mine.
There are too many rocks coming from the mine to harvest them all
so you’ve been tasked with writing a program
to analyze the mineral patterns of each rock,
and determine which rocks have the biggest minerals.

Someone has already written a computer-vision system for the mine.
It images each rock as it comes into the processing centre
and creates a cross-sectional bitmap of mineral (1)
and rock (0) concentrations for each one.

You must now create a function which
accepts a collection of integers,
each integer when read in base-2
gives the bit-representation of the rock
(again, 1s are mineral and 0s are worthless scalene-like rock).
You must return the cross-sectional area of
the largest harvestable mineral from the input rock, as follows:

The minerals only have smooth faces when
sheared vertically or horizontally from the rock’s cross-section
The mine is only concerned with harvesting
isosceles triangles (such that one or two sides can be sheared)
If only one face of the mineral is sheared,
its opposing vertex must be a point
(ie. the smooth face must be of odd length),
and its two equal-length sides must intersect
the shear face at 45° (ie. those sides must cut even-diagonally)
The harvested mineral may not contain any traces of rock
The mineral may lie in any orientation in the plane
Area should be calculated as the sum of 1s that comprise the mineral
Minerals must have a minimum of three measures of area to be harvested
If no minerals can be harvested from the rock,
your function should return nil"

    :description "A standard American deck of playing cards has four suits - spades,
hearts, diamonds, and clubs - and thirteen cards in each suit. Two is the lowest rank,
followed by other integers up to ten; then the jack, queen, king, and ace.

It's convenient for humans to represent these cards as suit/rank pairs, such as H5 or DQ:
the heart five and diamond queen respectively. But these forms are not convenient for
programmers, so to write a card game you need some way to parse an input string into
meaningful components. For purposes of determining rank, we will define the cards to
be valued from 0 (the two) to 12 (the ace)

Write a function which converts (for example) the string \"SJ\" into a map of
{:suit :spade,:rank 9}. A ten will always be represented with the single character
\"T\", rather than the two characters \"10\"."

    :description "In trick-taking card games such as bridge, spades,
or hearts, cards are played in groups known as \"tricks\" - each player
plays a single card, in order; the first player is said to \"lead\" to
the trick. After all players have played, one card is said to have \"won\"
the trick. How the winner is determined will vary by game, but generally
the winner is the highest card played in the suit that was led. Sometimes
(again varying by game), a particular suit will be designated \"trump\",
meaning that its cards are more powerful than any others: if there is a
trump suit, and any trumps are played, then the highest trump wins
regardless of what was led.

Your goal is to devise a function that can determine which of a number of
cards has won a trick. You should accept a trump suit, and return a function
winner. Winner will be called on a sequence of cards, and should return the
one which wins the trick. Cards will be represented in the format returned
by Problem 128, Recognize Playing Cards: a hash-map of :suit and a numeric
:rank. Cards with a larger rank are stronger."

For this problem, your goal is to \"flatten\" a map of hashmaps. Each key in your

map to get to a value, so for example {1 {2 3}} should result in {[1 2] 3}. You
only need to flatten one level of maps: if one of the values is a map, just leave
it alone.

In mathematics, the function f can be interpreted as an infinite matrix with infinitely
many rows and columns that, when written, looks like an ordinary matrix but its rows and
columns cannot be written down completely, so are terminated with ellipses. In Clojure,
such infinite matrix can be represented as an infinite lazy sequence of infinite lazy
sequences, where the inner sequences represent rows.

Write a function that accepts 1, 3 and 5 arguments

  * with the argument f, it returns the infinite matrix A that has the entry in the i-th
row and the j-th column equal to f(i,j) for i,j = 0,1,2,...;
  * with the arguments f, m, n, it returns the infinite matrix B that equals the remainder
of the matrix A after the removal of the first m rows and the first n columns;
  * with the arguments f, m, n, s, t, it returns the finite s-by-t matrix that consists of
the first t entries of each of the first s rows of the matrix B or, equivalently, that

    :title       "Parentheses... Again"
    :description "In a family of languages like Lisp, having balanced parentheses
is a defining feature of the language. Luckily, Lisp has almost no syntax, except
for these \"delimiters\" -- and that hardly qualifies as \"syntax\", at least in any
useful computer programming sense.

It is not a difficult exercise to find all the combinations of well-formed parentheses
if we only have N pairs to work with. For instance, if we only have 2 pairs, we only
have two possible combinations: \"()()\" and \"(())\". Any other combination of length 4
is ill-formed. Can you see why?

Generate all possible combinations of well-formed parentheses of length 2n (n pairs
of parentheses). For this problem, we only consider '(' and ')', but the answer
is similar if you work with only {} or only [].

There is an interesting pattern in the numbers!"
